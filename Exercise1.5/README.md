# Python for Web Developers

## Achievement 1
Build the command line version of a Recipe app, which acts as a precursor to its
web app counterpart in Achievement 2.

### Exercise 1.1

##### Learning Goals
* Summarize the uses and benefits of Python for web development
* Prepare your developer environment for programming with Python

##### Project Deliverables
* Install Python on Windows (screenshot).
* Install Visual Studio Code and make a scrip that adds two numbers that the user enters ("add.py script).
* Create and manage virtual environments (screenshots and requirements file).
* Use pip to install and manage packages (screenshots).
* Create a GitHub repo for the course.
* Document work in a README file (README file).
* Start a learning journal (learning journal).

### Exercise 1.2

##### Learning Goals

* Explain variables and data types in Python
* Summarize the use of objects in Python
* Create a data structure for your Recipe app

##### Project Deliverables

* Create recipe_1 (as dictionary, with the appropriate key/value pairs and the correct data type), recipe_2, recipe_3, recipe_4, recipe_5 and all_recipes (sreenshots).
* Print ingredients of all recipes to the console (screenshots).
* Document work and explain the rationale behind the choice of data structures (README file).
* Update learning journal (learning journal).

##### Notes

**Step 1**

The data structure I chose for the recipe was dictionary, because I need to associate values with keys to look for them efficiently by key.

**Step 3**
The data structure I chose for the recipes (all recipes) was list, because I need an ordered sequence in which the internal elements can be modified or deleted.

### Exercise 1.3

##### Learning Goals

* Implement conditional statements in Python to determine program flow
* Use loops to reduce time and effort in Python programming
* Write functions to organize Python code

##### Project Deliverables

* Create Exercise_1.3.py (Exercise_1.3.py).
* Initialize lists: recipes_list and ingredients_list (screenshot).
* Define function take_recipes (screenshot).
* Run For loops (screenshots).
* Print ingredients list to console (screenshot).
* Document work (README file).
* Update learning journal (learning journal).

### Exercise 1.4

##### Learning Goals

* Use files to store and retrieve data in Python

##### Project Deliverables

* recipe_input.py and recipe_search.py script files.
* Binary file (recipes).
* Screenshots of each step.
* Document work (README file).
* Update learning journal (learning journal).

### Exercise 1.5

##### Learning Goals

* Apply object-oriented programming concepts to your Recipe app

##### Project Deliverables

* recipe_oop.py script file.
* Binary file (recipes).
* Screenshots of each step.
* Document work (README file).
* Update learning journal (learning journal).
